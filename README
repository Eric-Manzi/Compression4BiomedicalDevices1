# Compression for biomedical

Deep compression of skin cancer classification &amp; segmentation for biomedical devices

## Objectives
- Apply SOT compression techniques to desing skin cancer classification and segmentation models that would run efficiently on edge devices in particular on biomedical equipment.

## Dataset
We will use the Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 dataset publically available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000), Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions:

- Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (AKIEC),
- basal cell carcinoma (BCC),
- benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses, BKL),
- dermatofibroma (DF),
- melanoma (MEL),
- melanocytic nevi (NV)
- vascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, VASC).
#### Downloading the data to googledrive via google colab

1. Mount your google drive
```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

2. Your kaggle token

```
import os
os.environ['KAGGLE_USERNAME'] = "xxxx" # username from the json file
os.environ['KAGGLE_KEY'] = "xxxxxx" # key from the json file
```

3. Download the dataset and copy into your drive
```
!kaggle datasets download -d surajghuwalewala/ham1000-segmentation-and-classification
!cp ham1000-segmentation-and-classification.zip drive/MyDrive/datasets

```
## Tasks tracking
- [ ] Reproducing the state of the art skin cancer classification and segmentation models
- [ ] Compressing the models developed
